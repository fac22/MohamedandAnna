Our challenge for the next two weeks is to build an agency website for your team.

Our website should give potential clients:

- [ ] An introduction to your agency/
- [ ] Information about each member of your team

## User Stories

**_A [user story](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story/) is a description of one or more features of a piece of software._**

### Core Stories

Together, you and your partner should decide who will lead on each user story. You may need to rely on each other for parts of the project. Split the work evenly between you both.

We have estimated each user story to give you a rough idea of how long it might take. We are assuming each developer’s velocity for this sprint is 5 story points.

For more information and definitions of these terms, see our [project management page](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/pre-app-5/project/handbook/project-management).

**As a potential client, I want to:**

- [ ] See information about each member of your team so that I can know who you are (E1)
- [ ] Browse your website on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices (E3)/// css and media query
- [ ] Click to navigate to different sections of your webpage (E1) /// NavBar
- [ ] Visit your website at a publicly accessible domain name (E2)/// Github pages

**Additionally, as a visually impaired user, I want to:**

- [ ] Navigate your website using keyboard controls (E2)//
- [ ] Hear my screen reader describe the content on your website (E1)//

## Acceptance Criteria

**_User stories come with [acceptance criteria](https://blog.easyagile.com/how-to-write-good-user-stories-in-agile-software-development-d4b25356b604?gi=dc603f56ed77) - a detailed scope of a user’s requirements._**

- [ ] Navigation menu
- [ ] ‘About us’ section///
- [ ] Images, text and external links/// READ ABOUT
- [ ] Semantic HTML elements

### Stretch Goal

Use the automatic trigger functionality of your [GitHub project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards).

Finally, feel free to get creative with the content of your website! Good luck!
